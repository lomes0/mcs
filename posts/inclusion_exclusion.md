15 indexed balls, and 8 indexed boxes.

What is the probability for exactly two empty boxes?





$\mathbb{P}(\{Exactly \space Two\})=1-\mathbb{P}(\{at \space most \space one \cup at \space least \space three\})=1-\mathbb{P}(\{at \space most \space one\}) - \mathbb{P}(\{at least three\})$

$=\mathbb{P}(\{at \space least \space two\}) - \mathbb{P}(\{at least three\})$.



**ERROR - Inclusion Exclusion**

Not intersecting properly.

This is a union of intersections. Not like the common case!
